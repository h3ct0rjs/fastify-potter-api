# fastify-potter-api
REST Api training, I build a simple crud for architecting an effective and efficient API using fastify, it will achieve  Speed,  documentation using swagger and create the architecture and sustainability of the code base.

# Install and Run

```sh
user@machine ~$ git clone https://github.com/h3ct0rjs/fastify-potter-api fastify_potter
user@machine ~$ cd fastify_potter
user@machine ~/fastify_potter/src$ cd src
user@machine ~/fastify_potter/src$ npm install 
```

you will need to seed the database using the `populatedb.js` script available in the _data_ folder

```sh 
user@machine ~/fastify_potter/src$node ./data/populatedb.js
```

then run in development mode :
```sh
user@machine ~/fastify_potter/src$ npm run dev 
```

you should be able to reach the api in `http://localhost:9000/api/` check if this is it with the information 
endpoint `http://localhost:9000/api/info` 

# Endpoints(In Progress)

All the information is availible in `http://localhost:9000/api/docs` generated by the 
swagger fastify plugin. 


# ToDo 

* Create api benchmarks.
* CI/CD Integration.
* Add unit testing with mocha.
* Add more data about the potter verse.

This was a quick and fast exercise to practice the Architecture and Sustainability of a rest API, 
there are multiple improvements that could be done. You can use this code to learn patterns or think in 
improvements.
